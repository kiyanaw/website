My name is Aaron, I'm software engineer and language learner of nÃªhiyawÃªwin (Plains Cree, Y-dialect). 
I grew up in the Rocky Mountain House area in Treaty 6 territory, my family is MÃ©tis of Red River descent (Caplette/Lafournaise) and mÃ´niyÃ¢w.
I've been learning nÃªhiyawÃªwin for about 6 years now, and as a self-study I know how hard it is to acquire an Indigenous second language as an adult. 
For that reason I've tried to put together some resources here in an attempt to aide other language learners in their journey.
